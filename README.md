How it works:
- Select the checkboxes you want to appear in the final images.
- Select the image you want as the background, a preview window will automatically open.
- In "Modify Rectangles" type the height and width of each square and press the "Update" button.
- In preview, use the mouse to move the squares to the desired position.
- Using the "Choose Capture Folder" button, select the image folder for a first image.
- Using the "Choose Logo Folder" button, select the image folder for a second image, important: they must have the same name as the "Capture Folder" folder.
- Using the "Choose Destination Folder" button, select the destination folder where the unification of the images will be stored.
- Finally press the "Unify" button to start the process.

Additional explanation:
To avoid problems, it is advisable to have all images in .PNG format.
It is recommended to add a prefix to the images so that they are sorted correctly (Example: "001., 002., etc."), there are free programs like "Bulk Rename Utility".
The text name will be from the images in the "Logo Folder" folder, without the extension.
If the "Next" or "Prev" checkboxes are selected, it will search the folders in alphabetical order ("sorted()") for the next or previous image or text.
